## 📥 How To Add the Extension to the Chrome Browser<a name="how-to-add"></a>

- Open the repository on GitHub and click the green 'Code' button dropdown
- In the 'Local' tab, select the option to 'Download ZIP' and download it to a temporary location on your computer
- Unzip the folder
- In the Google Chrome browser, select the 'Extensions' option (puzzle icon beside URL bar), then click 'Manage Extensions'
- Toggle the 'Developer mode' option (in the upper right corner) to on
- Select 'Load unpacked'
- Find the folder with the unzipped folder, and select it (note: do not double-click/'Open' it, just select it) and click 'Select Folder'
- Make sure it is enabled (the switch is blue)
- _Optional: Toggle the 'Developer mode' option (in the upper right corner) back to off_

⚠️ Important:
When adding this extension to Chrome via Developer Mode → Load unpacked, Chrome links directly to the folder on your computer — it doesn’t copy it elsewhere.
That means you should save the folder somewhere you don’t plan to move or delete (for example, Documents/ChromeExtensions/SiteBlocker).
If you move or rename the folder later, Chrome will no longer detect it and you’ll need to re-load it manually.

## 🖥️ How To Use the Extension<a name="how-to-use"></a>

- Select the 'Extensions' puzzle icon and click 'SiteBlocker'
- Add a website by entering input in the 'Add to Block List' input area, and select the 'Block' button
- To delete a website from your blocked websites list, simply select the trash icon beside the URL you want to unblock
  \*Note: websites should be entered in the format 'www.websitename.com' or 'websitename.com'

## 🛠️ To Do<a name="to-do"></a>

- Change favicon based on user's dark/light mode preference (white instead of green)
- Add a pause option to blocked site
- Add 'Are you sure you want to proceed' page to paused sites
- Limit saved sites + ensure stroage is cleaned when site unblocked
